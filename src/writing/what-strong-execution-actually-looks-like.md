High-performing teams miss targets sometimes. The difference is what happens next.

Strong execution has a recognizable pattern:

- Problems are surfaced early, not hidden.
- Owners are explicit and decisions are documented.
- Recovery plans have dates, tradeoffs, and accountable leaders.
- Lessons feed back into system and roadmap changes.

Weak execution often looks busy from the outside. Strong execution is quieter and more predictable because alignment is deliberate.

The goal is not to avoid every failure. The goal is to build a system that gets better after each one.
