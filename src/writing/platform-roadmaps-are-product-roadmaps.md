Platform teams are often asked to "enable everyone" while staying invisible. That creates backlog sprawl and weak prioritization.

A better model is straightforward:

- Define platform users clearly (internal teams are still users).
- Publish capability-level outcomes, not just technical tasks.
- Prioritize by shared business impact, not by whichever team escalates hardest.

If the platform roadmap is disconnected from product strategy, teams end up shipping around the platform instead of through it.

When platform work is treated like product work, reuse improves, reliability rises, and delivery velocity compounds over time.
