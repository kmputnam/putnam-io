Most strategy drift starts as unspoken assumptions. Teams move quickly, but in different directions.

The fix is not more process. It is a tighter decision loop:

1. Name the constraint.
2. Write the options.
3. Choose one direction and document why.
4. Define what evidence would change the decision.

When leaders do this consistently, teams waste less time debating old decisions and spend more time delivering outcomes.

In regulated systems, this discipline matters even more. Constraints are not edge cases; they shape product viability from day one.
